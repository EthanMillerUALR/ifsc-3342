  <h2>A WORLD RULED BY TYRANNY</h2>
  <h3>Prosperity. Liberty. Democracy. Our way of life. These things are under threat all around the galaxy because of attempted invasion by enemy forces. In light of these threats, we rely on the Helldivers, an elite peace keeping force who quells these attempts at uprooting our democracy through whatever means necessary.</h3>
  <h2>THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!</h2>
  <h3>The world is just full of places where our democracy is needed to establish the liberty and prosperity that only Super Earth can provide. As a Helldiver, it will be up to you to gear up, and spread that beloved democracy throughout the galaxy, wherever it may be needed.</h3>
  <h2>WORK WITH YOUR FELLOW HELLDIVERS!</h2>
  <h3>But do not fear, for you aren't alone!  Have up to 3 fellow Helldivers join you in the mission to spread democracy wherever it is needed. Work with your fellow soldier to ensure that Super Earth may establish its freedom across the galaxy!</h3>
  <h2>SEE EXOTIC NEW LIFE FORMS!</h2>
  <h3>As a Helldiver, you will be taken to many exotic places, and meet many more exotic species. It will be your job to manage these creatures, and deal with them in whatever means you think are necessary. Make sure to do your best to spread managed democracy through the entire galaxy!</h3>
